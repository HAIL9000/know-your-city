# Know Your City

Know Your City is a Portland non-profit that helps develop and promote events
focused on Portland's multicultural past and present. This project is a Django
backend that powers an interactive client side map of points of interest and
walking tours.

The points on the map are managed through the Django admin by KYC volunteers.
