# Know Your City

Know Your City is a Portland non-profit that helps develop and promote events
focused on Portland's multicultural past and present. This project is a Django
backend that powers an interactive client side map of points of interest and
walking tours.

The points on the map are managed through the Django admin by KYC volunteers.

# Technology

The administrative side is a basic Django app backed by PostgreSQL and likely PostGIS.

The front-end should not require a heavy single page app style Javascript
library; vanilla JS will probably even suffice.

The easiest front-end map to use is likely Google Maps.
